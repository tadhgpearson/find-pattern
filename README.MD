Find Pattern
============
You need to have npm installed.

To run the pattern finder:

> npm find-pattern <input>

You may also specify input from system in, like so

> npm find-pattern < cat inputfile

Notes
=====
If it weren't for that fact that Javascript cannot read from system in, you could run this with any package manager
